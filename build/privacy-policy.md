# Privacy Policy for PromptImpact Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** January 24, 2025

## Overview
PromptImpact is a Chrome browser extension that estimates the environmental impact (energy, water, and carbon footprint) of AI interactions across various platforms. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Collect
PromptImpact collects minimal information necessary for its functionality:

### Automatically Collected Information:
- **AI Interaction Metadata**: Text length, interaction type (text/image/video), and model type
- **Usage Statistics**: Number of interactions and cumulative environmental impact estimates
- **Timestamp Data**: When interactions occurred for historical tracking

### Information We DO NOT Collect:
- **Personal Content**: We do not read, store, or transmit the actual content of your conversations with AI systems
- **Personal Information**: No usernames, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information
- **Browsing History**: No data about your general web browsing outside of supported AI platforms
- **Account Information**: No login credentials or account details from AI platforms

## How We Use Information
The collected metadata is used exclusively to:
- Calculate environmental impact estimates (energy, water, carbon emissions)
- Provide cumulative statistics and model-wise breakdowns
- Display usage history within the extension popup

## Data Storage and Security
- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API
- **No External Transmission**: No data is sent to external servers or third parties
- **User Control**: You can clear all stored data at any time using the "Clear History" button

## Data Retention
- Historical data is kept locally until you choose to clear it
- The extension automatically limits storage to the last 1000 interactions to prevent excessive storage usage
- Uninstalling the extension removes all associated data

## Third-Party Integration
- The extension operates on AI platform websites (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) but does not integrate with their APIs
- No data is shared with these platforms beyond normal website interaction
- The extension only observes publicly visible content on these websites

## User Rights and Controls
You have complete control over your data:
- **View Data**: All collected data is displayed in the extension popup
- **Delete Data**: Use the "Clear History" button to remove all stored information
- **Disable Extension**: You can disable or uninstall the extension at any time
