- No noticeable impact on website performance
- Popup should update within 1-2 seconds of AI interaction
- Data should accumulate over multiple interactions

### Performance Expectations
- Fast popup loading (< 500ms)
- Minimal memory usage (< 10MB)
- No interference with website functionality

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Experience
1. Install extension
2. Visit ChatGPT
3. Have first conversation
4. Check popup - should show first estimate

### Scenario 2: Heavy Usage
1. Have 10+ interactions across different models
2. Check cumulative totals
3. Verify model breakdown table

### Scenario 3: Multi-Modal Usage
1. Use text, image, and video features
2. Verify different modes are detected
3. Check energy differences between modes

### Scenario 4: Long-Term Usage
1. Use extension for several days
2. Verify data persistence
3. Test performance with large history

## Troubleshooting

### If Extension Doesn't Work:
1. Check Chrome version (Manifest V3 requires Chrome 88+)
2. Verify all permissions are granted
3. Try disabling/re-enabling the extension
4. Check for conflicting extensions
5. Clear browser cache and reload

### If Data Seems Incorrect:
1. Verify model detection is working
2. Check token estimation accuracy
